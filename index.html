        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          I am a Math PhD, programmer, and complex problem-solver always up for
          hearing a pun or getting on a bicycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am driven by improving people’s lives through technology, and am
          seeking to solve difficult problems in a motivated environment
          surrounded by other talented people. I am seeking opportunities to
          work in software engineering and data science.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="programming">
        <h1>Programming</h1>
        I like solving problems with code. I have worked with several languages
        over the years, including Python, C&NoBreak;+&NoBreak;+, Haskell,
        Asymptote, Rust, Javascript / TypeScript, SQL, Lua, and PHP. Most of my
        programming projects are on
        <a href="https://github.com/phro">GitHub</a>, with a summary of selected
        projects below:
        <h2>
          <a
            href="https://www.erdosinstitute.org/project-database/spring-2024/data-science-boot-camp/analysing-road-safety"
            >Analysing road safety</a
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of this project was to predict collision rates in New York
          City using public road data and other geological features, and to
          identify key road infrastructures that can improve safety as
          economically as possible. Global analysis determined that traffic
          volume and street width were important factors, and individual feature
          analysis of speed humps determined that they reduce the collision rate
          by half!

          <a href="https://github.com/phro/dcl">Toki Pona syntax parser</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          The project goal was to implement a syntax parser for a human
          language. Using Haskell, I led our team to define production rules for
          a majority of the 140+ words and phrase structures in the constructed
          human language Toki Pona. To improve interactiveness, we added a
          visualisation of the resulting tree.
        </p>
        <p>An example of the output is below:</p>
        <pre>
$ dcl "mi wile sina" # (Translation: "I love you")

        <h1>PhD Thesis</h1>
        <p>
          I received my PhD in mathematics from the University of Toronto.
          <a
            href="https://github.com/phro/thesis/releases/download/v1.0.0/thesis-electronic-v1_0_0.pdf"
            >My thesis</a
          >
          was in algebraic knot theory. The project goal was to expand an
          efficient implementation of a strong knot invariant to a larger class
          of objects.
        </p>

        <p>
          I implemented novel algorithms and evaluated them on over 2000 test
          cases, and discovered a novel structure in the resulting data, which
          opened new avenues for research. Much of my work I implemented in
          software,
